Exploiting binaries is an extremely broad topic with many specialized
techniques for even the most exotic scenarios. In this writeup we will take a
look at exploiting \texttt{printf} with crafted format strings first and follow
up with an introduction about buffer overflows. Mitigation mechanisms will be
disabled at first and enabled one by one discussing them when they are put into
place. The buffer overflow will be augmented to inject and execute shell code
which is then prevented by the Data Execution Prevention (DEP) mechanism.

Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is introduced together with ret2libc to
circumvent DEP. Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is presented next as
counter to ROP but is quickly broken with an information leak. StackGuard is a
more sophisticated mechanism against ROP but not a silver bullet and can be
easily brute forced in certain scenarios. Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) together
with a word about Stack Integrity is provided as an outlook for the reader.

Some basic knowledge about the target platform (x86) is communicated before
running the first exploit, but we take a quick glance at other architectures
(x86\_64 and ARM) before concluding this writeup.

\section{Introduction}

Exploiting binaries was comparatively easy ten to fifteen years ago. There were
no special mitigation mechanisms in place denying even the most simplest
exploits. This is the point in time where we will start off. First we talk
about two very simple exploits, namely the Format String Exploit and the Buffer
Overflow in combination with Shell Code. Although there is a huge collection of
exploitation techniques known to the public, we will only look at a very small
fraction of them in this project.

The next section will communicate necessary background knowledge required to
fully grasp the two presented exploits. A short overview about the target
architecture x86 will be given.

After that, both techniques are introduced, followed by the first mitigation
technique, Data Execution Prevention (DEP). From there on we will keep on using
the buffer overflow technique with some adaptations to circumvent DEP. At that
point Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is introduced, directly leads to
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) the follow-up mitigation mechanism.
Again the buffer overflow technique can be adapted to break ASLR through the
use of additional information.

Since neither DEP nor ASLR provide significant protection against even this
simple technique, an additional mitigation has been put into place in the form
of Stack Cookies.

An outlook will be given after bypassing Stack Cookies by looking at Control
Flow Integrity (CFI).

Examples will be provided along the way support the reader and provide some
additional explanation. Finally we will conclude with a word about other
architectures (x86\_64 and ARM) followed by a recap about this project.

\subsection{Main Assumption}

Throughout this work we assume that we know the target binary (and the
libraries it uses). Let us show that this assumption is quite reasonable to
make by looking through the eyes of the adversary. An attacker who wants to
penetrate a target machine would most likely choose the easiest path, by
exploiting the weakest link. Most machines relevant to an attacker's interest
will provide multiple services. Consider following scenario:

The main server of a small business company runs a homemade communication
service for interaction between them and their clients. The attacker has no
access to the source or binary of this communication service's daemon running
on the target machine. But along with it a commonly used web server is
listening on port 80. Getting the source (and binary) of the web server is much
easier therefore an attacker would pick this entry point over the communication
service daemon.

    \label{src:http_response}
\end{listing}

\Cref{src:http_response} shows a possible response of a web server when
receiving an invalid request. The web server tells us his exact version and
since it also provides information about the operating system (distribution) an
attacker can easily mimic this setup to test and tweak his exploits. Exploits
may already be known to the public if the used version is not up-to-date. An
attacker could easily reuse them.

\section{Platform x86}
\label{sec:x86}

This section will teach necessary background knowledge about the target
platform to fully conceive the following techniques. But first let us elaborate
why x86 has been chosen.

At the time these techniques (and their related mitigations) were established,
x86 was the most common platform. The majority of related material found on the
internet covers x86, and many exploitation techniques can be translated from
x86 to other architectures with ease.

A more detailed overview can be found on
Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86}} and if this is not
enough for you, consider the Intel
Manual\footnote{\url{https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html}}
for a more profound insight.

\subsection{CPU and registers}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/x86_registers.pdf}
    \caption{Register overview including \SI{64}{\bit} extension}
    \label{fig:registers}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:registers} (from
Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=X86&oldid=696308590\#/media/File:Table_of_x86_Registers_svg.svg}})
shows an overview of registers available on the x86 platform. While there are
dedicated registers for floating pointer operations and registers with hardware
protection (segment registers) we will only focus on nine commonly used
registers.

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{description}
        \item[\texttt{EAX}] Accumulator Register
        \item[\texttt{EBX}] Base Register
        \item[\texttt{ECX}] Counter Register
        \item[\texttt{EDX}] Data Register
        \item[\texttt{ESI}] Source Index
        \item[\texttt{EDI}] Destination Index
        \item[\texttt{EBP}] Base Pointer
        \item[\texttt{ESP}] Stack Pointer
        \item[\texttt{EIP}] Instruction Pointer
    \end{description}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{gfx/single_register.png}
        \caption{Addressing specific parts of a register including \SI{64}{\bit} extension}
        \label{fig:single_register}
    \end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\bigskip

The instruction pointer \texttt{EIP} points to the next instruction in memory
which will be executed the subsequent cycle. Stack pointer \texttt{ESP} and
base pointer \texttt{EBP} are used for stack management which is vital to call
and return from multiple functions properly. The remaining six registers are
used for arithmetic and memory operations as well as passing arguments
(parameters) for system calls. Their values can either be interpreted as
integers or pointers.

Note that these registers can be addressed partially allowing one to write only
to the lower \SI{16}{bit}, for example, as displayed in
\cref{fig:single_register} taken from \textit{null
programm}\footnote{\url{http://nullprogram.com/img/x86/register.png} on
December 2015}.

The CPU comes with protection mechanisms which allows the operating system
kernel to limit other processes' privileges. This mechanism is known as
\textit{protection rings} (Ring 0 -- Ring 3). The kernel runs \emph{in} Ring 0
(most privileged) and switches to Ring 3 (least privileged) when a normal
process is scheduled. A system call is invoked by the process if it needs
something beyond its scope. The kernel takes over, deals with the request and
returns execution back to the process. This is known as \textit{context switch}
and switching between Rings happens along with it.

\subsection{System Calls}

As already mentioned in the previous paragraph, a process only has limited
capabilities and the kernel has to take over to fulfill certain (more
privileged) operations. The operating system's documentation tells you which
system calls are available (on which platform) and what parameters
each of them requires. Let us illustrate this with an example: On x86 Linux the
system call
number 4 (starting from 0) is the \texttt{sys\_write} system call which writes
data to a file descriptor. It takes three arguments, the file descriptor to
write to, a pointer to the start of the data which should be written and the
length of the data. The number of the system call together with these three
parameters are placed in the \texttt{EAX}, \texttt{EBX}, \texttt{ECX},
\texttt{EDX} respectively. To invoke the system call issue following
instruction:

\begin{nasmcode*}{linenos=false}
    int     0x80
\end{nasmcode*}

Nowadays you may encounter a different mechanism for system calls using Virtual
Dynamic Shared Objects (vDSO). This goes beyond our scope here, we will use the
previously mentioned mechanism in our exploits as they work side by side.
Consult the corresponding man
page\footnote{\url{http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html}} for
further reading.

\subsection{Memory}

Physical memory is managed by the operation system kernel by utilising the
Memory Management Unit (MMU). Each process' address space is virtualized and
memory operations are translated on-the-fly by the MMU. Physical memory is
segmented into \textit{pages} (typically \SI{4}{\kibi\byte} in size) and each
page can be mapped \emph{into} the virtual address space of one or more
(shared) processes.~\cite[pp.~400]{unix_interals}

The main parts located inside the (virtual) address space of a process are the
executable itself with its \texttt{.text} and \texttt{.data} section, the heap
(used for dynamic data), the stack (used for local variables and function
calling) and libraries.

\subsection{Endianness}
\label{sub:endianness}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{gfx/little_endian.pdf}
    \caption{Placement of bytes in memory in little-endian}
    \label{fig:little_endian}
\end{figure}

Endianness refers to the byte order used when storing data in memory (or
transmitting it over the network). x86 uses little-endian which is described in
\cref{fig:little_endian} (from
Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endianness&oldid=696417697\#/media/File:Little-Endian.svg}}).
The least significant byte of a word is placed at the lower memory address and
successive bytes are placed as the memory address increases. We will later
refer back to this when needed. The related Wikipedia
page\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness}} goes into more
detail about this than we need.

\subsection{Calling Convention}
\label{sub:calling_convention}

A calling convention defines how function calls should be implemented. What
calling convention is used depends on the platform, toolchain and compiler
settings. Let us exhibit what the convention defines and what convention we are
using (cdecl).

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
    Convention defines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Where to place arguments
        \item Where to place return value
        \item Where to place return address
        \item Who prepares the stack
        \item Who saves which register
        \item Who cleans up\\
            (caller or callee)
    \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
    C Declaration (cdecl):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Arguments on stack (reverse order)\\
            stack aligned to \SI{16}{\byte} boundary
        \item Return via register (\texttt{EAX} / \texttt{ST0})
        \item \texttt{EAX}, \texttt{ECX}, \texttt{EDX} saved by the caller\\
            rest saved by the callee
        \item On stack:\\
            old instruction pointer (\texttt{IP})\\
            old base pointer (\texttt{BP})
        \item Caller does the cleanup
    \end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\section{Format String Exploits}
\label{sec:format_string_exploit}

The first exploitation technique we will discuss builds upon the interpretation
of format strings. \texttt{printf} is a C function of the standard library
which will interpret such strings and print them to \texttt{stdout}. As the
name already tells you, the supplied string contains \textit{formatter}
describing how to handle additional arguments. If you are unfamiliar with
\texttt{printf} please have a look at the man
page\footnote{\url{http://linux.die.net/man/3/printf}} now.

Taking a closer look at \texttt{printf} we can see that its first argument is a
format string followed by a variable number of additional arguments.
\texttt{stdarg.h} describes a common implementation of this together with a
small example in their man
page\footnote{\url{http://linux.die.net/man/3/stdarg}}. As in that example,
\texttt{printf} trusts you that the number of arguments supplied is equal (or
greater) than the number of formatters. Calling \texttt{printf} with the format
string \texttt{"\%d + \%d = \%d"}, for instance, assumes that (at least) three
additional arguments are given.

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
        \cfile{../src/format_string/format.c}
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
        \begin{code*}{linenos=false}
            > gcc -o format format.c


            > echo foobar | ./main
            You entered:
            foobar


            > echo AAAABBBB | ./main
            correct


            > echo '%08x' | ./main
            You entered:
            bfd98ed4
        \end{code*}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Program vulnerable to Format String Exploits}
    \label{src:format_string_exploit}
\end{listing}

The exploit comes from the notion that a format string provided by an attacker
gets interpreted. The program shown in \cref{src:format_string_exploit} will
take an arbitrary string from \texttt{stdin} and pass it on to \texttt{printf}.
For simple inputs (not containing formatter) this works fine. But as soon as
formatter are provided, \texttt{printf} accesses the locations where the
corresponding arguments \emph{would} be located. From the calling convention
described in \cref{sub:calling_convention} we know that these arguments
\emph{would} be located on the stack, therefore \texttt{printf} will print
whatever lies on the stack at these positions instead.

An attacker in this scenario wants to get a hold of the hardcoded password
stored in \texttt{passwd}. Since local variables are placed on the stack
\texttt{printf} will be able to read the password if enough formatters are
provided:

\begin{code*}{linenos=false}
    > python -c 'print "%08x." * 10' | ./main
    bf920c14.00000064.b77de29e.00000000.00000000.b77fedf8.bf920d94.00000000.41414141.42424242.
\end{code*}

Here we use Python to craft the format string containing ten identifiers for
us. As we can see the password is printed (ASCII encoded). Byte order is
swapped because of endianness (see \cref{sub:endianness}). Apart from the
password we also gather a bunch of pointers, these can be used later on to
break ASLR (see \cref{sub:info_leak}).

We would like to point the reader to the book \textit{Hacking: The Art of
Exploitation}~\cite[pp.~167]{art_of_exploitation} for more details about this
and following techniques. We will come back to this technique later on to show
that \texttt{printf} enables even more sophisticated attacks.

\section{Buffer Overflow}
\label{sec:buffer_overflow}

The second type of exploits we'll look at is known as Buffer Overflows and as
on may already derive from the name, this is about submitting more data to a
buffer than it was originally designed for. This setup can be exploited when
bound checking is done wrong or not at all. An attacker is therefore able to
overwrite memory behind the buffer's location.

\subsection{Disabling Mitigations}

The three mitigation mechanisms DEP, ASLR and Stack Cookies are enabled by
default nowadays and as mentioned in the introduction we start off at a pointer
where these mechanisms were not. So to run the provided examples we first have
to disable them. DEP and Stack Cookies can be disabled via compiler flags to
the extend necessary using \texttt{-z execstack} and
\texttt{-fno-stack-protector} respectively.

ASLR can be disabled globally so that \emph{new} process' has an unscrambled
memory layout:

\begin{code*}{linenos=false}
    > echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
\end{code*}

Writing \texttt{2} instead of \texttt{0} will switch ASLR back to its default
state. Root privileges are, of course, required for this. There is also another
way by invoking \texttt{setarch}:

\begin{code*}{linenos=false}
    > setarch `arch` -R ./binary
\end{code*}

\subsection{The Exploit}

The consequences of an exploited buffer overflow depend on where the buffer is
located. The most interesting location would of course be the stack because,
apart from local variables and arguments, it holds the return address of a
function. But buffers located inside the heap or static may also be viable
options. Common terms related to these scenarios are \textit{stack smashing}
and \textit{heap corruption}. We will talk about heap corruption later on when
breaking ASLR, for now we focus our attention on stack smashing.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{gfx/stack_smash.png}
    \caption{Stack frame containing a buffer}
    \label{fig:stack_frame}
\end{figure}

Let's start off by examining the stack containing a buffer \texttt{c} as local
variable, see \cref{fig:stack_frame}. Right now the buffer holds the string
\texttt{"hello"} followed by a terminator. Since it has been allocated
to hold a maximum of \SI{12}{\byte} this fits. If data is written to the buffer
larger than \SI{12}{\byte} the following variable (or parameter) \texttt{bar}
will be overwritten, followed by the saved frame pointer and the return
address. If even more data is supplied the following stack frame will be
overwritten in the same manner.

If an attacker can provide the data written to the buffer and no (or wrong)
bound checking is done, he is able to inject arbitrary (malicious) code into
the stack frame. This could be, for instance, be used to overwrite a flag
indication whether an authentication has been performed successfully or not.
But since this is pretty forward let's go beyond that and see what happens when
changing the return address.

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.37\textwidth}
        \cfile{../src/buffer_overflow/overflow.c}
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.63\textwidth}
        \codefile{../src/buffer_overflow/overflow_objdump.txt}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Program vulnerable to buffer overflows}
    \label{src:buffer_overflow}
\end{listing}

As shown in \cref{src:buffer_overflow} we have a buffer suited for
\SI{20}{\byte} but without any bound checking. If the provided input is longer,
we will be able to overwrite the return address. Let's have a look at the
resulting binary utilizing \texttt{objdump}.

Looking at lines 13 and 23 we can infer that the buffer will start
\SI{28}{\byte} (\texttt{0x1c}) before the base pointer. Hence we have to supply
\SI{32}{\byte} (28 + 4) of arbitrary data followed by the address where we want
to jump to. Let's jump into the function \texttt{mordor} located at
\texttt{0x804849b}, keep in mind that the byte order needs to be swapped.

\begin{code*}{linenos=false}
> python -c "print 'A'*32 + '\x9b\x84\x04\x08'" | setarch `arch` -R ./overflow
Enter text:
You entered: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA��
One does not simply jump into mordor()!
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
\end{code*}

\texttt{mordor} has been executed successfully. Despite the segmentation
fault one can see that return address has been overwritten successfully.

\section{Shell Code}

While this is neat and can certainly be useful to an adversary, stack smashing
also enables us to inject arbitrary code into a program. Contrary to the
previous section the target machine will execute code provided by the attacker.
This can be achieved by bending the return address into the buffer used for the
exploit. Provided instructions will be executed upon return. Shell code is a
piece of (binary) code which opens up a shell that reads and executes commands
from an attacker. This example is taken from Dhaval Kapil's
blog\footnote{\url{https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/Shellcode-Injection/} on
December 2015} there is also a section about this in \textit{Hacking: The Art
of Exploitation}~\cite[pp.~281]{art_of_exploitation}. There is also a
comprehensive article \cite{phrack_stack_smash} about Stack Smashing on
\texttt{phrack}\footnote{\url{http://phrack.org/}}.

\subsection{Crafting Shell Code}

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
        \nasmfile{../src/shell_code/shellcode.asm}
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
        \codefile{../src/shell_code/shellcode_objdump.txt}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Assembly code opening up a shell upon execution}
    \label{src:shell_code}
\end{listing}

The piece of assembly shown in \cref{src:shell_code} sets up the parameters for
the \texttt{execve} system call and than invokes it to replace the currently
running process with a shell. \texttt{execve} takes three arguments, a string
of the program to execute (here \texttt{"/bin//sh"} + terminator), a list of
arguments for that program and a list of environment variables. Its system call
number is 11 and it will accept \texttt{NULL} for both lists. The double slash
in the first argument is used to prevent null bytes inside the shell code. The
function which reads the shell code may truncate it upon reading a null byte,
therefore we have to work around this without changing the underlying
semantics.

Running this code through an assembler yields binary code, shown in
\cref{src:shell_code}, which will be part of the payload.

\begin{code*}{linenos=false}
    \x31\xC0\x50\x68\x2F\x2F\x73\x68\x68\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x89\xE3\x50\x89\xE2\x53\x89\xE1\xB0\x0B\xCD\x80
\end{code*}

\subsection{Examining the Target Binary}

Finding the starting location of our buffer will be a little bit more
complicated, we cannot read it directly from the binary of the target program
so, in \cref{src:shell_code2}, we'll examine it in a debugger .

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}
        \cfile{../src/shell_code/vuln.c}
    \end{minipage}\hfill
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
        \codefile{../src/shell_code/vuln_gdb.txt}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Examining the target binary in \texttt{gdb}}
    \label{src:shell_code2}
\end{listing}

Now we know that the buffer will be located at \texttt{0xbffff4bc} (saved base
pointer will be at \texttt{0xbffff528}) at runtime, but it may be offset a few
bytes when run without debugger. This happens because environment variables and
meta information, like the program name, determine the stack starting position
(stack is placed right before environment variables). Hence we may not hit the
first instruction of our shell code right away, but since the buffer is bigger
than the actual payload we can improve our odds by prefixing the shell code
with \texttt{NOP} instructions. As long as the return address points somewhere
into this sequence of \texttt{NOP}s the CPU will \emph{slide} to the first
instruction of the shell code. Therefore this is known as a
\textit{\texttt{NOP} Sled}. We append some arbitrary data to the shell code as
offset to overwrite the return address. This is also illustrated in
\cref{fig:shell_code} where \textit{target} is new return address supplied by
the attacker. Using the maximum amount of \texttt{NOP}s possible would also be
a viable option, here we just went with the original example.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{gfx/shellcode.tikz}
    \caption{Putting the payload together}
    \label{fig:shell_code}
\end{figure}

Let's first calculate the distance between the start of the buffer and the
return address. The return address will be located \SI{4}{\byte} after the
saved base pointer location.

\[(\texttt{0xbffff528} + 4) - \texttt{0xbffff4bc} = 112\]

We prefix our shell code with a \texttt{NOP} Sled consisting of \SI{40}{\byte}
(opcode for \texttt{NOP} is \texttt{0x90}). Since our shell code is \SI{25}{\byte}
long we add 47 \texttt{'A'}s to gap the remaining distance. Lastly we have to add
the new return address which should point to the \texttt{NOP} Sled's center.

\[\texttt{0xbffff4bc} + 20 = \texttt{0xbffff4d0}\]

\subsection{Gimme that Shell already}

\codefile[linenos=false]{../src/shell_code/run.txt}

After injecting the payload we get a few lines of garbage and receive a prompt
by hitting return a few times. You can enter commands and receive output like
usual.

\section{Data Execution Prevention (DEP)}

The first mitigation technique discussed, DEP, is also known under the term
\textit{write XOR execute (\texttt{w\^{}x})} and it will prevent us from
executing injected code like we did in the shell code example previously. This
happens by attaching an execute flag to each page (in addition to the read /
write flags). If the instruction pointer points to a page without the execute
flag set, a segmentation fault will be triggered. The only pages flagged for
execution are the ones that belong either to the \texttt{.text} segment or to
used libraries (by default) since they will contain the program code. The stack
is (of course) not executable by default. Therefore our shell code example
would simply segfault.

The execution flag is enforced by hardware on modern platforms. But for CPUs
that lack such hardware support, software-enforced DEP provides limited
protection.~\cite{wiki:dep}

Previously we worked around this by passing \texttt{-z execstack} to the
compiler, hence data on the stack was executable. This can also be seen in the
output of \texttt{readelf}.

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \codefile{../src/shell_code/vuln_readelf.txt}
    \caption{\texttt{readelf} output with and without \texttt{-z execstack}}

    \caption{Running the shell code example without \texttt{-z execstack}}
    \label{src:dep_shell_code}
\end{listing}

\Cref{src:dep_readelf} shows that with \texttt{-z execstack} the stack section
is marked (looking at \texttt{Flg} in lines 8 and 19) with execute
(\texttt{E}). Running the example, see \cref{src:dep_shell_code}, yields the
segfault described in the previous paragraphs. The program is terminated upon
receiving the segfault.

DEP makes injection arbitrary code into binary much harder, but we still
control the return address --- so let's use it.

\section{Return Oriented Programming (ROP)}

The first example shown in the \cref{sec:buffer_overflow} already illustrated
the power that comes along with controlling the return address. It enabled us
to jump to a completely different function upon execution. The target binary
may not contain a function doing exactly what an attacker wants to do. But by
controlling the return address one can build a, so called, \textit{ROP chain}
to execute (more or less) arbitrary code, which is made out of
\textit{gadgets}.~\cite{wiki:rop,buchanan2008good,shacham2007}

\subsection{Gadgets}

A gadget is a, usually short, sequence of instructions ending with a
\texttt{ret} instruction.

An attacker scavenges the target binary (and used libraries) for such sequences
in order to combine them to build a new, malicious sequence of instructions.
The size and diversity of the code base dictates the diversity of available
gadgets and therefore the difficulty of building a specific sequence.

The shell code used in this paper could be mapped to three gadgets, for
example. The first one pushes the string \texttt{"/bin//sh"} onto the stack,
the second one sets up the registers (arguments) and the last one calls the
\texttt{execve} system call.

The final \texttt{ret} statement of a gadgets is required for chaining them
together. We not only use the Buffer Overflow to control \emph{one}, but
\emph{multiple} return addresses. Because of this our payload will be made up
by a list of return addresses (the start of each gadgets) interleaved by some
padding. Each provided address will be consumed one by one at the end of each
gadgets to \emph{jump} to the next one. The payload may still contain data like
\texttt{"/bin//sh"} if necessary.

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \codefile{../src/return_oriented_programming/gadgets.txt}
    \caption{Finding available gadgets in a binary}
    \label{src:rop_gadgets}
\end{listing}

One can easily get a list of available gadgets by piping the output of
\texttt{objdump} to \texttt{grep} filtering for \texttt{ret} instructions. This
is done in \cref{src:rop_gadgets} where three different gadgets can be
observed. Of course each gadget can be arbitrary long, we just used a length of
5 instructions in this example.

There are algorithms and tools available which simplify the process of finding
such gadgets (and even whole chains) but they go beyond the scope of this
writing.~\cite{shacham2007}

\subsection{Example}

This example is taken from a blog
post\footnote{\url{http://codearcana.com/posts/2013/05/28/introduction-to-return-oriented-programming-rop.html}}
on Code Arcana, which also includes a simpler as well as a more complex example
about ROP.

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Example for exploiting a Buffer Overflow with ROP}
    \label{src:rop_example}
\end{listing}

The target program is displayed in \cref{src:rop_example}. We will not be able
to inject and execute shell code, and there is no function present which
directly opens up a shell for us. But there are parts which can be used to do
so.

On the right hand side we see the execution of the exploit. First note that we
no longer compile the binary with \texttt{-z execstack}. We read the locations
of \texttt{not\_used} and \texttt{system} via \texttt{gdb} and note down the
corresponding addresses. \texttt{objdump} is used to have a quick glance at the
generated binary code for \texttt{vulnerable\_function} and note down the
distance between the saved base pointer the start of the buffer too (line 17).

Putting this together yields following payload: Starting with some
\texttt{'A'}s to fill the buffer followed by 4 \texttt{'B'}s to overwrite the
saved base pointer. The next part is new, we attach the address of
\texttt{system} followed by some padding and a pointer to \texttt{not\_used}.

We happily receive a shell upon running the exploit. Execution will be handed
back to the original binary after we close the shell. Since we messed up the
control-flow with our exploit the program segfaults shortly after.

This is also described as \textit{ret2libc} since we used ROP to jump to a
function (\texttt{system}) provided by libc.

\section{Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)}

This mitigation technique was introduced to render ROP (and ret2libc) void. The
idea behind it is quite simple, and the name gives it away already. Memory
layout is randomize so an attacker cannot reliably use ROP. An attacker will
not be able to copy the exact setup of a target machine by only knowing which
binary (and libraries) is used.

    \end{code}
    \caption{Let \texttt{cat} show its memory mappings with ASLR enabled (some
lines have been omitted)}
    \label{src:aslr_cat}
\end{listing}

ASLR is enabled by default and one can easily check the implications by running
\texttt{cat} on \texttt{/proc/self/maps} a few times as shown in
\cref{src:aslr_cat}. Line 10, 19 and 28 show, for example, that the stack
starts at different locations in memory each time cat is invoked.

We can directly see one flaw in this setup --- not all sections of the
\texttt{cat} binary start at random locations. Especially the \texttt{.text}
always starts at the same position. This happens because \texttt{cat} itself
was not compiled as a Position Independent Executable (PIE). Since this is
actually the default of \texttt{gcc}, most programs' \texttt{.text} segment
will always start at the same location. One could pass the corresponding flag
(\texttt{-pie}) to the compiler to prevent this, so ASLR would be able to
randomize these segments too.

Breaking ASLR, even when the code is compiled with \texttt{-pie}, is easier
than it seems at first. Relocation only happens to a section at whole,
functions inside a section still share the same relative distance as they would
without ASLR. But before exploit this fact have a look at the randomized
addresses again.

Only three nybble ($3 \times \SI{4}{\bit}$) differ between multiple runs giving
us $2^{12} = 4096$ possibilities. If the scenario allows it, brute forcing is a
viable option here. But note that this changes drastically for \SI{64}{\bit}.
But we won't hassle with brute force, a better option has already been teased.

\subsection{Info Leak}
\label{sub:info_leak}

ASLR can be broken easily as soon as \emph{one} pointer to a section of
interest gets \emph{leaked}. Therefore the name information leak. We show the
implications of such a leak by an example taken from \cite{rpisec}.

\begin{quote}
    Lets say you managed to leak a pointer (\texttt{0xb7e72280}) and you know
    that this one usually points to \texttt{printf}.
    \medskip

    Look how far away \texttt{system} is from \texttt{printf}, in the standard
    library. It's \texttt{0xd0f0} bytes.
    \medskip

    We now know that \texttt{system} is at:
    \[ \mathtt{0xb7e72280} - \mathtt{0xd0f0} = \mathtt{0xb7e65190} \]
\end{quote}

In case you may wonder how easy it is to leak a pointer, this already happened
to us as a side effect in the format string example
(\cref{sec:format_string_exploit}).

Our previous exploit can be adapted as follows. First, manage to leak a pointer
somehow, which enables you to calculate the address offset introduced by ASLR.
Augment your ROP chain to take the offset into account. Run the exploit. Since
this is rather simple and we already gave an example how to calculate the
offset, we would like to leave this as an exercise for the reader.

Manipulate the target file used in the ROP example to print the address of
\texttt{printf} first, \emph{then} read in the payload via \texttt{stdin}. This
way you can first simulate a leaked pointer, adapt the ROP chain and run it.
Double check the distances between functions in the libraries, they may differ
with the ones used in this writeup.

\section{StackGuard}

DEP can be fooled by ROP and ASLR is rendered useless with a simple info leak.
Something else is required at this point. Thinking back, the original problem
emerged from manipulating the return address located on the stack. Two
(additional) counter mechanisms were introduced going by the names of
StackGuard and StackShield. We will take only a look at StackGuard and one
relatively common scenario to break it, but there is a comprehensive article
\cite{phrack_stack_guard} on \texttt{phrack}\footnote{\url{http://phrack.org/}}
describing and breaking both mechanisms.

The general idea behind StackGuard is to place \emph{something} before the
return address which \emph{guards} against overwriting the return address via a
buffer overflow. This \emph{something} is known as a canary and comes in
different forms.

\begin{description}
    \item[Terminator] A terminator canary contains a sequence of commonly used
        terminator symbols (like null, EOF, linefeed, \dots) to
        \emph{terminate} \emph{most} string operations before they would change
        the return address.

    \item[Random] A random canary is chosen at program start, stored
        \textit{somewhere save} and pushed into the stack upon function calls.
        The canary on the stack is checked against the one stored before
        executing the return instruction. The program is terminated upon
        mismatch. With this setup an attacker has to know the canary in order
        to overwrite the return address. Since it is chosen at random during
        program start, an attacker cannot reliably reproduce the same canary in
        his cloned setup.

        In our case the original canary will be stored in one of the segment
        registers\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=X86_memory_segmentation&oldid=697253060}
        see \textit{Later developments}}.
\end{description}

There is also the random XOR canary which XORs the (stored) random canary with
the return address before placing it on the stack. ``This is effectively
encryption of the return address with the random canary of this
function.''~\cite{phrack_stack_guard}

The practical approach is taken next by looking at the stack frame of a
vulnerable function when compiled without \texttt{-fno\_stack\_protector}.

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.32\textwidth}
        \cfile{../src/canary/vuln.c}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.33\textwidth}

    \end{minipage}

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Examining the canary as generated by GCC}
    \label{src:canary_gcc}
\end{listing}

As can be seen in \cref{src:canary_gcc} the buffer was not filled beyond its
capacity to examine the canary located in the same stack frame. A script
created by Daniel Walter\footnote{\url{http://0x90.at/post/gdb-stack-script}}
has been adapted slightly to display the stack together with some annotations.
Using \texttt{"AAAAAAA\textbackslash{}n"} and
\texttt{"BBBBBBB\textbackslash{}n"} makes the buffer clearly visible in lines
16 and 17. The canary can be observed in line 18.

The canary itself is composed of a terminator (null) followed by a random
sequence of \SI{3}{\byte}. This sequence changes very time the program is run.
Feeding more data to the buffer and overflowing it this way yields termination
of the program. Note that \texttt{puts} is still executed, the termination
happens just before the return of \texttt{fun}.

\begin{code*}{linenos=false}
    > echo AAAAAAAADEADBEEF | ./vuln
    AAAAAAAADEADBEEF

    *** stack smashing detected ***: ./vuln terminated
    Aborted (core dumped)
\end{code*}

\subsection{Server Worker Paradigm}

Of course there are multiple paths available when trying to break the
StackGuard mechanism, as mentioned in \cite{phrack_stack_guard}. We will now
have a look at the common server worker paradigm. \Cref{src:server_worker}
shows how that paradigm looks like from a task monitors view. The server /
daemon (here \texttt{apache2}) is started with root privileges in order to
listen on a \textit{privileged} port. After the initialization has been
compiled the server forks itself multiple times to create a set of workers. In
this example the workers drop their root privileges right away by changing
their current user to \texttt{www-data}. But our focus is not on the privileges
but the problem introduced by fork with respect to the StackGuard.

\begin{listing}[h!]
    \codefile[linenos=false]{gfx/server_worker.txt}
    \caption{Server worker paradigm from the view of a task monitor}
    \label{src:server_worker}
\end{listing}

Many things are copied\footnote{Actually referenced utilizing a copy-on-write
method} over to the new process when using \texttt{fork}. The canary is copied
too (more details at \cite{phrack_stack_guard2}). Together with the
fact\footnote{We assume that the server wants to maintain a maximum of
availability} that the server will fork itself again if one of its workers dies
or crashes to keep the worker pool at its configured sized.

An attacker will be able to guess the \emph{same} canary multiple times since
the server will keep spawning workers if they crash --- even due to a stack
smash. The attacker receives information about whether his guess was correct or
not by whether his connection has been terminated. And now to the meat of this
method.

Have a look at \cref{src:canary_gcc} again and reexamine the canary. While
occupying \SI{4}{\byte} only 3 of them are random --- first byte acts as a
terminator. We have already seen via previous examples that a buffer overflow
often allows writing to consecutive memory \emph{byte by byte}. Putting this
information together yields following upper bound for brute forcing a canary in
the described scenario:

\begin{align*}
    \implies 2^8 \times 3 & = 768  & \text{ guesses at most on \SI{32}{\bit}}\\
    \implies 2^8 \times 7 & = 1792 & \text{ guesses at most on \SI{64}{\bit}}
\end{align*}

Again, this is just \emph{one} of many different ways to work around the
StackGuard mechanism. Depending on your operating system's and compiler's
implementation this may or may not work. We encourage the reader to try this
technique locally with a minimal example. Running the exploit multiple times
and recording the runtime (number of guesses) may be of interest.

\section{Control-Flow Integrity (CFI)}

In this section we are going to have a short glimpse at Control-Flow Integrity,
but before that we need to talk about the Control-Flow Graph (CFG).

\subsection{Control-Flow Graph (CFG)}

Again the name already tells you what this is about, a direct acyclic graph
(DAG) that reflects the control-flow of your program. There are different
definitions regarding what is actually placed in the nodes of the graph and
what are the anchor points of the program used to connect them. In our case we
will create a node out of each function body and connect them at function
calls.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gfx/unraid_part_graph.png}
    \caption{Truncated control-flow graph example}
    \label{fig:cfg}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:cfg} shows part of such a graph in
IDA\footnote{\url{https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/}} analyzing the
\texttt{emhttp} binary used by
unRAID\footnote{\url{http://lime-technology.com/what-is-unraid/}}. There are
much nicer graphs available to explain the concept, but we wanted to inject
some real world data. From the graph you can already tell that the function
(subroutine) labeled \texttt{licensing} will call \texttt{malloc},
\texttt{memset}, \texttt{USB\_STUFF}, \dots. Thats actually all we care about
for now.

\subsection{Back to CFI}

CFI is a big topic and, like other topics already mentioned, goes beyond the
scope of this writeup. The first pointer we will hand you aims at corresponding
section\footnote{\url{http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html}} of
the Clang documentation, but we encourage you to checkout the related research
paper \cite{ms_cfi} for more information. A more accessible and recent way to
this topic may be the
talk\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA0VK7s5tSQ}} \textit{New
memory corruption attacks: why can't we have nice things?} given by gannimo
(Mathias Payer).

The CFG has already been established, now let's see how it can be used to
counter the buffer overflow return address dilemma. At compile-time the graph
is available and can be used to create additional constraints which the program
must obey during runtime. This is similar to the StackGuard mechanism where we
attach code to the end of a function which checks if the canary is still
intact. But now we don't check for a canary but for the validity of the return
address. From the CFG we can build a set of possible return targets for each
function. Looking back at the example shown in \cref{fig:cfg} we can determine
that the function \texttt{szDecrypt} returns either to \texttt{USB\_STUFF},
\texttt{licensing} or one other subroutine excluded by the illustration. The
corresponding addresses are put into this set which is then stored in the
binary. Before the function \texttt{szDecrypt} returns the return address on
the stack is compared to the entries listed in the corresponding set. If no
match can be found, the program terminates.

With this mechanism setup, one can easily see that it is no longer possible
chain \emph{arbitrary} gadgets together to pull off ROP. But we still control
the return address and can jump to different locations as long as we stick to
the CFG. Each transition from one node to another has to be valid, while the
overall path taking by our ROP chain may do things never intended by the
program's author. This concept is known as control-flow bending.~
\cite{cf_bending}

\subsection{Stack Integrity}

Using a changed return address is what ultimately enables control-flow bending.
Stack integrity ensures that the same return address is used upon executing the
\texttt{ret} instruction as was pushed upon function call. This can be achieved
by using a \textit{shadow-stack} similar to the StackShield mechanism but we
suggest reading about \textit{code-pointer integrity} \cite{cpi} regarding this
topic.

\subsection{There is an interpreter in your C}

We conclude this section by mentioning the availability of an interpreter
(probably) available in your standard library. As presented by gannimo,
\texttt{printf} is far more capable than just printing arguments. It is also
possible to read and \emph{write} to memory locations. But one can go even
further and craft a format string mimicking each of the eight operators of
Brainfuck\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck}}. Because
Brainfuck is Turing complete we can deduce that \texttt{printf} is a Turing
complete interpreter. Note that this requires \texttt{printf} to be called in a
loop and the format strings may depend heavily on your libraries
implementation. (Also not all implementation are Turing complete).

A compiler accepting Brainfuck and spitting out the corresponding format
strings, including examples can be found on HexHive's
GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/HexHive/printbf}}.

\section{Other Architectures}

We have already reasoned about why x86 was the platform chosen for all this in
\cref{sec:x86}, but now we'll have a short look at two other common platforms.
Most of this is directly taken from \cite{rpisec} with some smaller additions.

On x86 instructions range from \SIrange{1}{15}{\byte} and one can even bend the
instruction pointer between instructions to yield a completely different
execution than originally available.

\subsection{x86\_64}

x86\_64, also known as x64 and AMD64, is at its core a \SI{64}{\bit} extension
to x86 which already replaced a lot of x86 machines. Its general purpose
registers are \SI{64}{\bit} wide and there are eight more of them.

We will find the most interesting difference in the calling convention,
\textit{fastcall}, where (the first few) arguments are passed via registers
instead of pushing them onto the stack. This makes ROP much easier.

Contrary, breaking ASLR gets much harder since the address space is \emph{much}
bigger which yields more entropy for the randomization. This renders brute
force (and heap spraying) basically useless, but we can still resort to the
info leak. Breaking a canary via brute force gets only a little bit harder, but
this has already been shown.

\subsection{ARM}

ARM CPUs will be encountered mostly in portable, low-power-oriented devices
such as smart phones and tables, but are also used in embedded devices like
routers. It consists of an \SI{32}{\bit} RISC instruction set with a
\SI{16}{\bit} mode (THUMB). The used calling convention is basically the same
as under x86\_64 (fastcall)

Compared to the previous both, ARM has a \SI{4}{\byte} instruction alignment
--- \SI{2}{\byte} under THUMB.

A heads up about caching: on ARM cache has to be flushed manually (or via large
memory operations).

\section{Conclusion}

String with no mitigation mechanisms in place, we have seen how easy it is to
manipulate the program by exploiting just one simple buffer overflow. Going
beyond simple manipulations like changing locale variables, we craft shell code
and injected it to open up a shell accepting and executing arbitrary inputs.
Next, Data Execution Prevention (DEP) was presented to deny the ability of
\emph{injecting} new code.

This was countered by introducing Return Oriented Programming (DEP) (and
ret2libc) which removes the requirement of injecting new code to exploit a
binary. This is done by combining code fragments (gadgets) already available in
the target binary and libraries to build new, malicious sequences of
instructions.

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) can be defeated with an information
leak and even the StackGuard mechanism can broking with brute force (including
an unexpected low upper bound) in certain scenarios.

The basic idea behind Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) was communicated after this
followed by a small glance at \texttt{printf}'s capabilities to work as an
interpreter. Along the way references have been provided to aid the reader.

Before concluding with this section a short word about other architectures and
their influence on these techniques has been given,

Happy Hacking
